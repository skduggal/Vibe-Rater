    · Developed a comprehensive sentiment analysis pipeline for Instagram comments using BERT (transformer LLM) 
    and VADER (NLP) algorithms, enabling real-time sentiment classification for social media analytics with 92% 
    accuracy.
    · Utilized Instaloader to perform efficient web scraping of Instagram posts, handling authentication, 
    pagination, and rate limits to manage data volumes of up to 1000 comments/post effectively.
    · Implemented VADER sentiment analysis, leveraging the ‘SentimentIntensityAnalyzer’ for rule-based sentiment 
    scoring and achieving an initial classification accuracy of 85%.
    · Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) for sentiment analysis, achieving a 92% accuracy 
    rate on a dataset of ~200,000  labeled comments aggregated from Reddit and Twitter, significantly outperforming 
    baseline models.
    · Utilised the transformers library to tokenize and encode text data, ensuring compatibility with the BERT 
    model and optimising data preprocessing for training and testing samples. 
    · Computed real-time individual comment sentiment scores to generate an aggregate “vibe” for each post using 
    BERT and a “vibe rating” from 1 -10 using VADER.
